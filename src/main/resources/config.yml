# the update period, in seconds, between time steps

updatePeriod: 5

# -*- TAXES -*-
# Tax for buying is calculated as:
#   taxFlatBuy + (1+taxRateBuy) * PRICE
#   for a single purchase.
# However, if someone buys 10 stock at once,
#   they are charged 1 taxFlatBuy, then the PRICE is updated
#   internally 10 times, and they are then added together
# This is to make it so that each of the 10 iron are bought at different prices,
#   so people can't game the system by purchasing a whole lot and inflating the market
#
# Similiarly, taxes for selling is calculated as:
#  PRICE*(1-taxRateSell) - taxFlatSell
#
# Again, for selling many items, the price is incrementally calculated
#

# the flat tax that is charged per transaction
taxFlatBuy: 25
# the tax rate, as a portion of the entire amount purchased
taxRateBuy: 0.065

# the flat tax that is charged per transaction
taxFlatSell: 12
# the tax rate, as a portion of the entire amount sold
taxRateSell: 0.032
